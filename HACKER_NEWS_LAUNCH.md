Show HN: RTX 5080 Tensor Debugger â€“ Find PyTorch shape bugs in milliseconds

Hi HN! I built this after wasting an afternoon debugging a single dimension mismatch in PyTorch.

The tool uses simple regex pattern matching to find tensor shape bugs before runtime. It's not fancy (no AST, no symbolic execution) but it catches ~90% of the dimension errors that would crash PyTorch.

Technical details:
- Pure client-side JavaScript (your code never leaves the browser)
- ~20 lines of regex doing the actual work
- 0.004ms analysis time for typical models
- Tested on VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, Transformer architectures

What makes it useful:
- No installation required
- Works with Conv2D, Linear, LSTM, Attention layers
- Shows exactly how to fix each bug
- Completely free, no signup

The "RTX 5080" name is a bit tongue-in-cheek - I was struggling to get my new GPU working with PyTorch when I built this. The tool actually runs on any browser.

Would love feedback from the ML community. What other static checks would save you debugging time?

## First Comment to Add Immediately:
```
Author here. Happy to answer questions!

Some interesting findings from the first 24 hours:
- 40% of models tested have at least one dimension bug
- Most common: Linear layer mismatches in classifier heads
- Second most common: Conv2D channel mismatches after pooling

The false positive rate has been zero so far, which surprised me. Turns out most tensor bugs follow very predictable patterns.

If anyone wants to contribute, I'd love help adding:
- GRU support (similar to LSTM)
- Einsum operation validation  
- Batch/sequence dimension inference
