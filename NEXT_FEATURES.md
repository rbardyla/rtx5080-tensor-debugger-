# Next Steps After MVP

## Path 1: Expand Tensor Debugger (1-2 weeks each)

### Level 1: Quick Wins (This Week)
- [ ] VS Code extension - inline tensor checking
- [ ] CLI tool - `npx tensor-debug model.py`
- [ ] GitHub Action - PR checks for tensor bugs
- [ ] Batch processing - check entire folders

### Level 2: Premium Features ($19/mo)
- [ ] API access for CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Custom rules ("batch size must be 32")
- [ ] Team sharing & collaboration
- [ ] Export detailed reports (PDF)
- [ ] Slack/Discord integration

### Level 3: Enterprise ($99/mo)
- [ ] On-premise deployment
- [ ] SSO/SAML authentication
- [ ] Audit logs & compliance
- [ ] Priority support
- [ ] Custom layer types

## Path 2: New Tools Using Same Formula

### The Formula That Worked:
1. Find tedious debugging task
2. Build simple regex/pattern solution
3. Ship in browser (no install)
4. Focus on ONE thing done well

### Ideas Following This Formula:

**1. CUDA Out of Memory Predictor**
- Estimate GPU memory BEFORE training
- Catch OOM before wasting time
- Same UI style as tensor debugger

**2. Training NaN Detector**
- Find operations that cause NaN/Inf
- Gradient explosion prediction
- "Your learning rate will cause NaN at epoch 3"

**3. Import Dependency Analyzer**
- "You imported X but never used it"
- "This import adds 500MB to your Docker image"
- Clean up bloated ML projects

**4. Hyperparameter Sanity Checker**
- "Your batch size 1024 with lr=0.1 will diverge"
- Based on empirical rules from papers
- Save failed training runs

## Path 3: Platform Play - "Debug Tools for ML"

### "TensorTools.ai" - Suite of ML Debugging Tools
- Tensor Shape Debugger âœ… (done)
- Memory Predictor (1 week)
- NaN Detector (1 week)
- Import Analyzer (1 week)
- Hyperparameter Checker (1 week)

**Monetization:**
- Free: 1 tool, 10 uses/day
- Pro $29: All tools, unlimited
- Team $99: Shared workspace

**Why This Works:**
- Each tool markets the others
- Same audience (ML engineers)
- Compounds your reputation
- Multiple chances for viral hits

## Path 4: The Bold Pivot - "Clippy for ML"

### AI Debugging Assistant
- Watches your code as you type
- Suggests fixes BEFORE you run
- Learns from your patterns
- "Looks like you're building a CNN. Common bug: Conv channels"

**Tech Stack:**
- VS Code extension
- Local LLM for privacy
- Your regex patterns as base rules
- User feedback loop for learning

## Path 5: The Data Play

### Aggregate Anonymous Bug Data
- "Most common PyTorch bugs of 2024"
- "Which architectures have most bugs"
- "Bug patterns by experience level"
- Sell insights to PyTorch team

## My Recommendation: Path 2 + 3

**Week 1-2:** Add VS Code extension for current tool
**Week 3-4:** Build "CUDA Memory Predictor" with same UI
**Week 5-6:** Build "NaN Detector"
**Week 7-8:** Launch TensorTools.ai platform

**Why:**
- Leverages your momentum
- Each tool is 4-hour build (you proved this)
- Multiple viral opportunities
- Clear monetization path

## The Meta Lesson

You spent weeks on NeuronLang (0 users).
You spent 4 hours on Tensor Debugger (100+ users).

**The pattern is clear:**
- Simple > Complex
- Specific > General
- Shipped > Perfect

Whatever you do next, ship it in 4 hours.
