# How to Publish RTX 5080 Tensor Debugger to VS Code Marketplace

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 20+** (Required by vsce)
   ```bash
   node --version  # Must be >= 20.0.0
   ```

2. **Visual Studio Marketplace Publisher Account**
   - Go to: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
   - Sign in with Microsoft account
   - Create a publisher ID (e.g., "rtx5080-dev" or your username)

3. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**
   - Go to: https://dev.azure.com/[your-organization]/_usersSettings/tokens
   - Create new token with:
     - Organization: All accessible organizations
     - Scopes: Marketplace > Manage

## Step 1: Prepare Extension Files

All files are ready in `/tmp/rtx5080-tensor-debugger/`:
- ✅ extension.js (main code)
- ✅ package.json (manifest)
- ✅ extension-README.md (documentation)
- ✅ test-example.py (demo file)

## Step 2: Update Publisher Info

Edit `package.json`:
```json
"publisher": "YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID",
```

## Step 3: Build Extension Package

```bash
# Install vsce globally (requires Node 20+)
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Package the extension
vsce package

# This creates: rtx5080-tensor-debugger-1.0.0.vsix
```

## Step 4: Test Locally First

```bash
# Install in VS Code
code --install-extension rtx5080-tensor-debugger-1.0.0.vsix

# Open test file
code test-example.py

# You should see red squiggles on tensor bugs!
```

## Step 5: Publish to Marketplace

```bash
# Login with your PAT
vsce login YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID

# Publish
vsce publish

# Or publish in one command with PAT
vsce publish -p YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Step 6: Marketplace URL

Once published, your extension will be at:
```
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID.rtx5080-tensor-debugger
```

## Step 7: Add to Reddit Post

Update your Reddit post with:
```markdown
