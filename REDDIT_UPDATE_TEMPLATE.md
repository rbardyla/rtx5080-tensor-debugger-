ðŸš€ **UPDATE: VS Code Extension Released!**

Thanks for all the interest! I've packaged the tensor debugger as a VS Code extension.

**Install directly:** 
```bash
# Download from GitHub
wget https://github.com/rbardyla/rtx5080-tensor-debugger-/releases/download/v1.0.0/rtx5080-tensor-debugger.vsix

# Install in VS Code  
code --install-extension rtx5080-tensor-debugger.vsix
```

**Features:**
- ðŸ”´ Red squiggles under tensor dimension mismatches
- ðŸ’¡ Hover tooltips with exact fixes
- âš¡ Real-time checking as you type
- ðŸ“Š Status bar shows bug count

**Try it:** Open any PyTorch file and watch it catch bugs instantly!

GitHub: https://github.com/rbardyla/rtx5080-tensor-debugger-

Working on getting it into the official marketplace, but you can use it now!
```

## Where to Post

1. **Your original r/deeplearning post** - Add as edit or comment
2. **r/vscode** - New post: "Made a VS Code extension that catches PyTorch tensor bugs in real-time"
3. **r/pytorch** - Cross-post with focus on PyTorch debugging
4. **r/MachineLearning** - If they allow tools (check rules first)

## Engagement Strategy

When someone comments "How do I install this?":
```markdown
Super easy! Two ways:

1. **Quick install** (if you have VS Code):
   - Download: [Direct link](https://github.com/rbardyla/rtx5080-tensor-debugger-/releases)
   - Run: `code --install-extension rtx5080-tensor-debugger.vsix`

2. **From source**:
   - Clone the repo
   - Open in VS Code
   - Press F5 to test

Let me know if you hit any issues!
```

When someone asks "Does it work with [specific setup]?":
```markdown
It should! It uses regex to detect tensor operations, so it works with:
- âœ… Any PyTorch version
- âœ… Jupyter notebooks (.py files)
- âœ… Google Colab (if you download as .py)
- âœ… CPU or GPU code

The pattern matching is simple but effective - catches most Linear and Conv2d mismatches.
```
