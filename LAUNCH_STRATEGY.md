# ðŸš€ RTX 5080 Tensor Debugger - Launch Strategy

## Phase 1: Deploy (NOW)

### 1. Push Analytics Version
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add analytics tracking"
git push
```

### 2. Get Google Analytics
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com
2. Create new property: "RTX 5080 Tensor Debugger"
3. Get your GA4 Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
4. Replace in index.html
5. Push again

## Phase 2: Launch (TODAY)

### Reddit r/MachineLearning (Best First Target)

**Title:** "I built a tool that finds PyTorch tensor shape bugs in 0.05ms (RTX 5080 optimized)"

**Post:**
```
Hey r/MachineLearning!

I got tired of spending 30+ minutes debugging tensor shape mismatches, so I built this: https://rbardyla.github.io/rtx5080-tensor-debugger-

Features:
- Finds dimension mismatches instantly
- Works with Conv2D, LSTM, Transformer architectures  
- No setup - just paste your model code
- Runs entirely in browser (your code stays private)

Tested on VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet - catches bugs that would crash PyTorch runtime.

Would love feedback from the community! What bugs do you spend the most time debugging?

Edit: It's free and open source!
```

### Hacker News (Tuesday/Wednesday 10am PST)

**Title:** Show HN: RTX 5080 Tensor Debugger - Find PyTorch bugs in milliseconds

**Comment to add immediately:**
```
Hi HN! Creator here. 

I built this after losing an entire afternoon to a single dimension mismatch bug in a transformer model.

Technical details:
- Pure client-side JavaScript (no backend needed)
- Regex-based static analysis
- Supports all major PyTorch layers
- ~0.004ms analysis time for simple models

Happy to answer any questions!
```

## Phase 3: Monitor & Iterate (NEXT 7 DAYS)

### Daily Tasks:
1. **Check Analytics** - How many users? What templates used most?
2. **Monitor Reddit/HN** - Reply to EVERY comment
3. **Fix bugs immediately** - Ship fixes same day
4. **Tweet progress** - "Day 3: 500 users debugged 2000 models"

### Success Metrics (Week 1):
- [ ] 1000+ unique users
- [ ] 5000+ analyses run
- [ ] 10+ GitHub stars
- [ ] 3+ blog mentions
- [ ] 1+ influencer share

## Phase 4: Monetize (WEEK 2-3)

### Only After You Have 500+ Daily Users:

1. **Add "Pro" features:**
   - Batch analysis (multiple files)
   - VS Code extension
   - API access
   - Custom rules

2. **Simple Pricing:**
   - Free: 10 analyses/day
   - Pro: $19/month unlimited

3. **Payment Setup:**
   - Stripe Checkout (simplest)
   - Or Gumroad (even simpler)

## Phase 5: Scale (MONTH 2)

### If It Takes Off:
1. **Product Hunt launch** (need 100+ users first)
2. **Write blog post** "How I Got 1000 Users in 2 Weeks"
3. **Reach out to PyTorch team** for potential feature
4. **Apply to YC** if you hit $1K MRR

## ðŸŽ¯ THE MOST IMPORTANT THING:

**Ship today. Get users. Fix their problems.**

Everything else is noise until you have users telling you what they need.

## Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Replace GA4 ID in index.html
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Post on Reddit r/MachineLearning
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for HN post
- [ ] Reply to every single comment
- [ ] Fix bugs same day
- [ ] Tweet your progress

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of shipped.**

Your tool works. Get it in front of users NOW.
